# Linear Algebra

This module provides the fundamental building blocks for numerical computation in the geometry processing framework. It is designed to mirror the API of the original `linear-algebra-js` package while leveraging the performance and safety of Rust.

## Types

### [Complex](./complex.md)
Represents a complex number $a + bi$.

### [Vector](./vector.md)
Represents a 3D vector $(x, y, z)$.

### [Dense Matrix](./dense_matrix.md)
A dense matrix of real or complex numbers.

### [Sparse Matrix](./sparse_matrix.md)
A sparse matrix in Compressed Column Storage (CCS) format.
